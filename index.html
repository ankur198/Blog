        <h3>Nullable Reference Types</h3>
        <h2>Adventures with C# 8</h2>
        <div id="content">
            <article>
                <h4>How it all started</h4>
                So today I finally migrated to VS 2019 preview and dotnet core 3 (and started this blog too). First
                thing I was interested to try was the new Nullable Reference types. I found instruction how to migrate
                your code for C# 8 and its new features, but I was not ready yet to make the mess and then fixing it.
                <br>

                I created a new project with dotnet core 3, and nothing happened, null was treated like before. Here's
                how to fix it. <br>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>If you are like me and want to first experiment on Hello World application then:-</h4>

                in <code>csproj</code> file add these two lines <br>
                <code>
                    &lt;LangVersion&gt;8.0&lt;/LangVersion&gt; <br>
                    &lt;NullableContextOptions&gt;enable&lt;/NullableContextOptions&gt;
                </code>
                <br>
                <code>NullableContextOptions</code> applies Nullable Reference types features for the whole project.
                <br>
                <div class="warning">
                    This setting will be enabled by default when C# 8 is released (not in preview mode). So if you are
                    watching in future you don't have to do anything.
                </div>
            </article>
            <article>
                If you are ready to upgrade your projects to C# 8 you can do what the same as above, but you will be
                bombarded with thousands of warning for using null objects. It can become some what overwhelming. In
                this situation you might want to only enable this feature for a limited files.
                <h4>To enable locally on a file:-</h4>

                in <code>csproj</code> file add these two lines <br>
                <code>
                    &lt;LangVersion&gt;8.0&lt;/LangVersion&gt; <br>
                    &lt;NullableReferenceTypes&gt;enable&lt;/NullableReferenceTypes&gt;
                </code>
                <br>
                Notice that here we are using <code>&lt;NullableReferenceTypes&gt;enable&lt;/NullableReferenceTypes&gt;</code>
                instead of <code>&lt;NullableContextOptions&gt;enable&lt;/NullableContextOptions&gt;</code>.
                <br>
                <br>
                To tell C# compiler which files should have null reference checking we will then have to add <code>#nullable
                    enable</code> preprocessor directive on top of file. And that's it.
            </article>

            <article>
                So what this feature actually does, well it can be a whole article in separate but to have an overview
                it can be understood as a feature that checks for null reference during compile time. You will have to
                declare with <code>&lt;T&gt;?</code> to allow that variable to store null. So whenever you try to
                consume that variable later visual studio will give you a warning that it could be null and should have
                null checking. <br>
                Roslyn compiler is smart enough to understand when you have checked for null (e.g. by <code>?</code>,<code>??</code>,
                <code> == null</code>,etc ) and will not give you any warnings.
                <br>
                However this does not make your code null-safe. Some exceptions are:-
                <br>
                If your code or some external dependency was not compiled with this feature enabled compiler could not
                give warnings.
